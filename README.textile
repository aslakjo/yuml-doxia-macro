h1. Doxia macro for yuml.me

*Include UML diagrams in your Maven site*

This macro for Doxia provides an easy way to include UML diagrams in your project documentation. The
macro uses the "yuml.me":http://yuml.me site to generate the diagrams, and makes it possible to describe
the models in yuml.me's textual syntax directly in, for instance,
"APT":http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/apt-format.html documents.
